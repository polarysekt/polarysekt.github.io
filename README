## Local Live Preview

To preview the BLOG locally, you will need a few prerequisites:

### Ruby Gems

#### Debian

```sh
# apt install ruby-full
```


### bundle

```sh
# make _get_bundler
```

If you are uncomfortable running sudo prior to a make command, you can simply do:

```sh
# sudo gem install bundler
```


You can update bundler:

```
$ make _update_bundler
```

### Install required gems

```sh
$ make _get_gems
```

If you run into difficulties, such as a particular package not being found, try:

```sh
$ rm Gemfile.lock
```

and retry

```sh
$ make _get_gems
```


Now you should be able to run the server.


### Local LiveReload Server

```
$ make _serve_livereload
```
