Just in time for pi-day (although unfortunately it's not Friday), the polarysektion is back online, and now at a stable URI, so we should be "Steady As She Goes" from here on out.

Aside from a few minor 'tweaks' to the UI, most of the structure is in place, and the scaffoling is being slowly peeled away.

There are many posts still caught in the interrim, whether in transition from other areas or just not yet complete, so there will be a bit of a sporadic posting as those come to a (somewhat) final draft state.

This current interface is turning out to be nice and flexible, while quite minimal, although the splash images appear to take up just a bit too much visual space. Additionally, there seems to be quite a bit of horizontal space wasted on the higher-res displays, so a responsive multi-columnar or grid layout will be in store for that area.

Some work will be done to clear up display issues (with maintained focus on Responsiveness), as well as some behind the scenes cleanup to the automation that consolidates and reduces bloat.

Stay tuned! More PI links are likely on the horizon, before even the sun dips below.
