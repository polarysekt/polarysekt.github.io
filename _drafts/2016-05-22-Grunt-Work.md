"Ready for work." (Oh wait, that's what the peons say).

"Give me focus..." (Different game, but closer to the original intent...).
<pre>Everything I know about <em>[blank]</em> I learned from Warcraft / Starcraft.</pre>
[Circular argument about war and peace and how they must either both exist or they would both cease to exist]. And then, maybe after having read War and Peace (which I have not, maybe something about that, as well).

People have many times asked me, what's with that `gw` moniker you claimed for a while a few years back? Right? I mean, they're not your initials, and it would be a little more than creepy to post an ex-girlfriend's boyfriend's initials (prior to even them even having met...), so what's the deal?

Well my kitty, pretty much foreshadowing went into the development of that particular acronym. And by foreshadowing I'm leaning more towards the shadow with a bit of emphasis on the forecasting of foreknowledge, seeming incomprehensible unless you dial back the (apparently) restrictive nature of the fourth dimension.

How was I to know that I could write so much into something introductive once thinking above but not reductive because of wooden forest rakes. Iron wouldn't work because time takes into account weather's wear and tearing rust aside from carbon strengthened alloy hides just wouldn't make it without an endless supply of oil, lest our allegorical tinman was quite the mega apparatus not unlike the design of Dr. Light.

Makefiles were the [link]name of the game for so long that I hardly thought about another possibility for a tool, much less one that actively kept track of changing content in realtime by its very nature.
\Wondering what's' believed to be, what I need, and what I think I can do needs to see itself displayed.

I once told Amanda that it stood for Geoff's Way, but Geoff's work would also fit that height requirement. And yes, this might just be the aforementioned ex-girlfriend about whom everyone was so worried. And maybe they were right to be concerned, but now there's a long time passed since the old Geoff's skin cells shed a few times and abrased by the sands of time and washed away with the rain.

There's a certain kind of energy that comes with the spring storms, however inconvenient they might be.

Maybe it was God's Way, or a way about which I could not comprehend, but pretend for a second to listen to me, and think to yourself, is this just misery gone awry?

And if not God, or the Great Arbiter, or Architect, or some other manifest of ultimate representation, far beyond that which us petty humans could ever understand, then at least unity of consciousness; mind, body, and soul intertwined at a higher level than any one of the dumb constituent beasts could ever even pretend to understand.

And if one still wants to argue for another way, then let that be, but at least hear me out, because it is no secret that greater powers do exist -- just add another mind to whatever was once thought to be the greatest, and your infinity becomes even greater. No wonder no one ever tries to fully understand, or at least never makes it, or gives up trying as the yeast expands too far and with too much heat before solid ground could once again be trodden underfoot.

Who it for? Who four it? For it, who? Just forget about it...
