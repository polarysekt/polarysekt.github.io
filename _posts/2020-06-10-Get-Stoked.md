**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Before I get started, I want to make it completely clear that I am about to describe something
that involves risk. Yes, actual danger. And as per my usual I smile and tell a joke, (often deeply and dryly satirical).
So, yeah, you've been warned.


NOTE: Keep in mind you will have to do more work during tax season.

NOTE: trades are subject to fees from the SEC and fINRA
