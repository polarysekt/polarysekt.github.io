# Init Polarysektion

```python
def __init__(self):
```

or

```c++
void Polarysektion() {}
```

or 

whatever your preferred [CTOR](/glossary/#CTOR) might be.


## Anyway

In times past, partial implementations of hastily compiled blogs were usually thrown together hurredly and somehow supposed to be taken as something useful. Well, in very minor ways, some posts were, but not as you would say "blog-worthy", assuming of course you speak like that.

Here at the polarysektion, we speak like that. Also, there are still many hastily thrown-together posts that have not yet elevated from draft status.

In any case (or more specifically, `default`, in this particular `switch` ), this is the new and (hopefully) improved iteration. Though it may just be yet another variation on a similar theme.

So this blog aims to be about what is... not what could be- or what once was prior to thousands of irreversible changes...

We'll roll back about two [permutation](/glossary/#permutation)s, and create entirely new [combination](/glossary/#combination)s.

## Outtro

Don't stop, just return control to the system.

```python
    pass
```

```c++
    return 0;
```

We assume the [DTOR](/glossary/#DTOR)s were called automatically.
