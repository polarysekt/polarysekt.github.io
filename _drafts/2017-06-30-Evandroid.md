# Evandroid

## Prologue

I'm told now that eventually this will begin to make sense, but as it is currently being salvaged from a time-travelling black box, the wreckege is only partially available.

Once crunched into the confines of our new environment, our containerisation began to make more sense. Generally, as light waves [or particulates] along as causality, polarized, so as to become blind or antiblind as if he that were in the eyes of the mindsight minds of those who were the fittest
clothing,

Emerging from binary can be difficult in a semi-deci-digital world.

The strap you left should boot your right shoulder on, don't ask me about the left.

Evandroidman-san
Am I not real?

I'm with you...
Let's check on the StatRep
We've got no time on our hands, Landcast;

It's all feet now.

But there is no time, either, is there?
Not this moment, at least. But there will be. All that you could ever imagine, and far greater still.

No one wanted to know why there were not any dilapidated muse visages present. Very few probably even understood about what Evan was even going on, as even his sentience dragged on longer than even one of TC's doozies of a sentence. Luckily he weren't manually diagramming this one. That was done naturally, by processes created, yet somehow still unexplainable.

Despite the new features, a few creatures retreated back beyond their respective individual stances. Casual glances enhanced by a glimmer of (oct)-ant glances of a cat eating a sandwhich, wearing spectacles, glaring intently at the diagram, a mere dram slight of death. 

Reprogramming in process. 

But these were hardly two dimensional representations in childrens' coloring wax displayed on tapered abutments(sp?), manhandled and weathered, only to be revived just in time for compiling into existence.

"Woah, what is that? A spider?" An obligatory unanswerable question from the student to which the professor could only reply:

"No, but damn close, my friend. For this spider-like apparition has been found to be just enough of a disturbance to the electro chemical response you call 'human emotion' to provide a simple way to test for robots.

"Why not just use the tried and true voigt-kampf method?" asked the student, curiously undertaking divergent intangible thought processes that were escalating in ferocity as if driven by some outside force.

"Because this test is a disturbance to the underlying filament and, while not a spider per se, so as to be detected by vital signatures, it is actually inanimate, designed by intelligent minds above and beyond our comprehension, and in fact permeated far deeper than even its creator could imagine."

So our best weapon against the autonomids wascreated by them?

Yes. But this is not the first time such a dependency were attained.


[Having been familiar with voigt-kampf and the like]

Lights, in response to the movement of [two messengers], flicker hesitantly before [opening fully],[ blanketing] the two scrawny figures in a flood of brilliantly fractaled prism reflection revealing metallic walls and floor.
One of the messengers stands back, allowing the other to approach the automated guard alone.

After less than [a] half [a] millisecond, the drone groans, and lurches laterally and blows a gasket rendering him inoperable.

Transporters reported distress signals so four dimensional reconaissance autonomotons were sent to record the actual events as they occurred.

While it was difficult to comprehend, it was simply an unconscious action that lasted less time than it took.

                    Reconaissance autonomoton OGH reports the following:

I live with the idea of a question intact.
What would have happened when he pushed through, and finally gotten somewhere.
The membrane was not as thick at specific points. He repeatedly tested the edges until he was certain there were not any doubts about his point of fracture. And so he did tear, straight through
until there was no going back.


Are you absolutely certain we've completely allocated the proper convenience factors?

Sure. Unless there were other factors to be considered.

Well of course there were other factors.

Factory stank of overworked molasses and salt. Salty molasses, simple as that, rough, uncut stubble.

There wasn't much more that was even worth talking about.

What more would one want to know?






It all came down to the simple hypothesis that []



the spider-like creature would sneak in and eat the host's main circuitry, replacing it with cells designed to trace back to its origin and self destruct.
