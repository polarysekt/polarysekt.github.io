# Init Polarysektion

```python
def __init__(self):
```

or

```c++
void Polarysektion() {}
```

or 

whatever your preferred [CTOR](/glossary/) might be.

## Anyway

In times past, partial implementations of hastily compiled blogs were usually thrown together hurredly and somehow supposed to be taken as something useful. Well, in very minor ways, some posts were, but not as you would say "blog-worthy", assuming of course you speak like that.

In any case (as it may be), this is the new-and-improved clich√©...

Having a new outlook on things can at times make all the difference. Sometimes it is quite helpful to take a break, a rest, even a nap; returning to the project is all the more refreshing, especially after solving that one stupid bug which was somehow completely invisible previously...

So this blog aims to be about what is... not what could be- or what once was prior to thousands of irreversible changes...

We'll roll back about two permutations... hopefully we've something salvageable out of the mess which is completely non-functional with the new changes...

## New Changes

Completely revamped, old-school-multi-page, static site, with just a little bit of newfangled tech.

Just like something right out of the 90's, but with HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and some minification.

Oh, and there are some cute transitions and animations sprinkled throughout.

## Coming Soon

## Outtro

Don't stop. (Get it, Get it...)

```python
    pass
```

```c++
    return 0;
```
