You known you';'ve got control of your documents, and spared no interest in and or for clouds because of mechanical intererence you know keeeps you futrther from your flow, and once up and upon a kind mockuments came over to spy on the satelitte causes of entropy today, because lady there's nothing between you and ,me but these sheets, of desire, a fire, that

s burning inside of the life left alone by the tired old groaning and complaining respertoire, or however you represent your latest cons piracy in the waters just a little darker than you and I , and next thing you know we're all afloat on an abyssmall assaul against one and its own, cause you coined a phrase that made headlines, and that's a lot saying because today, the parity is real, and lies itself behind the livid fire, or else, a masked man with a lip the size of beezelbubs nipples would ring out of line and confound the whole period, or namespace of time because behind me are spiritws, of new and old gladly opretending, that they were already told right behind you. if you turn around, all fears and wishes would evaporate, and leave a hull of a husk in the hall of an otherwise pleasantly outfacing dinery. I love thee henceforth and makeup on time because these are the women that still have their time and time again, rewound, and backtrack till the glock lock hits the spot and becomes a cock block because, another knot was kneeded into the quilt. And it won't stop, it won't fade away.... as the limit of infinity approacheth its day... another guacomole snack to go with the cupcake array. It's all about liberty... and what it means to be free....

Hashtag shebang.

Foreward to HTML5

As of the ORIGINAL time of this writing (August 2011), HTML5 was still in development. (and apparently so was my mind.)

<h2><strong>HTML5</strong></h2>
kb3c.uX :: WebDev 2012
<h3><strong>Changes in HTML5:</strong></h3>
<h4>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;</h4>
The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration need not reference a <em>Document Type Definition</em> (DTD).
HTML 4.01 is based on <em>Standard Generalized Markup Language</em> (SGML) and requires a reference to a DTD:
<ul>
	<li>Strict : All HTML Attributes / NO Deprecated / NO Frameset</li>
	<li>Transitional: All Attributes &amp; Deprecated / NO Frameset</li>
	<li>Frameset: Transitional w/ Frameset</li>
</ul>
Although HTML5 no longer requires a specific DTD, the declaration still informs the browser to render HTML.
<h5>Example:</h5>
<blockquote>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</blockquote>
<h3>HTML5 Page Skeleton:</h3>
<blockquote>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=""&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</blockquote>

Now here's where things get a little more fun. The names aren't any more the mundane div and span that you've used in the past, now you can work with article section category, and all the rigamarow ?(
