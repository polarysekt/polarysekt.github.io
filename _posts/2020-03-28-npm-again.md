# npm again

Here we are again.

## Say NO to sudo

npm will look for settings in the following order:

* per-folder './.npmrc'
* per-user '~/.npmrc'
* system-wide '/etc/npmrc'

if none of those are found, it will use a system-dependant builtin

Also, the per-folder settings are only read if located in the current folder.

npm can also be configured through environment variables, `userconfig` and `globalconfig`, which can be set per-shell.

global installs will try to install to /usr or /usr/local/ or /var inside a /lib or /lib64 with a symlink in /bin so an issue with permissions arises.

npm cli packages are often easier to use if installed globally.
While it might be tempting to change the user or group of /usr/local/bin, using the configuration, 
by setting the prefix to a user-accessible location, npm -g can be called without requiring elevation of privileges.

Generally dependency packages are installed for each project, although the size can add up rather quickly with several projects going. Instead of wiping the node_modules every time, you can use npm link.

when installed locally, npm links any binaries into the node_modules/.bin folder
