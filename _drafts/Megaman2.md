So Megaman, right?

Lately I've taken to speedrunning Megaman 2 (or more specifically, Rockman 2). It all started with the release of the Megaman collection for the Nintendo 3DS. While my favorite was always Megaman 3, mainly for sentimental reasons, I chose Megaman 2 for my introduction into speedrunning. I must note that I'm still about 10 minutes or so off the world record mark, so there's nothing really to show, yet. However, through practice I've gotten rather comfortable actually beating the game, something I never quite accomplished as a child.

Why Megaman 2? Several reasons.
<ol>
 	<li>I owned the game as a child, so I had a little practice coming in.</li>
 	<li>No sliding mechanic. The sliding mechanic introduced in later games bumps the difficulty up quite a bit.</li>
 	<li>It's IMO the easiest Megaman game, so a good place to start.</li>
 	<li>The zips!</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

As a child I started with Megaman 3, so there was some ___ aspect to the game. I've always been a fan of 2D platformers, especially throughout the evolution of graphics capability. While fully 3D games are quite immersive, I prefer being locked to just two dimensions.

When I <del>began</del> resumed playing through Megaman, I was wholly unaware of the "zips" utilized in speedrunning.
