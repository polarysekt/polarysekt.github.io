# npm

## Introduction

Node Package Manager (npm) :: [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/)

npm is the default package manager for `node` (or `nodejs`). 

Please refer to the article on [node](node) for more information about `node` itself.

## Initialize npm

To initialize a `package.json`:

```sh
$ npm init
```

## Add a project dependency

NOTE: dependencies are, by default, installed into the `node_modules` folder. As this is a generated folder, it is generally preferable to include this path in `.gitignore`. For more details, refer to the [git](git) article.

To add (and subsequently install) a dependency, i.e. `TypeScript`, use:

```sh
$ npm add typescript
```

This will fetch and install the typescript dependency and its dependencies.

To install multiple dependencies, such as `TypeScript` and `express` they can be specified together on the command line:

```sh
$ npm add typescript express
```

Added dependencies will be saved to `package.json`. Additionally, a `package.json.lock` file will be created/updated with dependency-specific versioning information.

`package.json` has two sections for dependencies: 

```json
  "dependencies": {
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    ...
  }
```

To add a dependency into `devDependencies`, pass the `--save-dev` argument to `npm` on the command line:

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev typescript
```

or:

```sh
$ npm install typescript --save-dev
```

## Update a dependency

Dependencies can then be updated with `npm update`:

```sh
$ npm update typescript
```

## Install project dependencies

While dependencies are installed as they are 'added' to a project (see above), they are usually not included in (they are `.gitignored` from) a repository when cloning locally.

To install dependencies, use:

```sh
$ npm install
```
