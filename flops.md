# Flops

Fast Lightweight Online Poker Simulation.

The very original implementation was to be a Microsoft Windows Screensaver. There may be traces of this somewhere, and they will be collected here if discovered.

Following the initial groundbreaking, some system-wide changes were introduced, and the project was shelved for a while.

With a new push and initiative, the FLOPS project was then iteratively realized, to be used as a portfolio example (or proof of concept).

* First Iteration: currently the sources are under review and are not currently available.
* * [Gallery](flops-i1)

* Second Iteration: with a little backing and support, this was implemented as some side chew in `python`.
* * [https://webflops1.herokuapp.com](https://webflops1.herokuapp.com) - Please note: there is an intentional latency involved in loading this page as it is using only the free service provided.

* Third Iteration: a push to a full stack javascript/Typescript framework saw another core rewrite.
* * [Gallery](flops-i3)

* Fourth Iteration: Mobile Progressive Web Application *In Development*
* * C++ (possibly rust)
* * Web Assembly
* * Typescript/Javascript
* * HTML5
* * CSS3
