The Network, a.k.a the Spider's Web, a.k.a the man with 8 long skinny fingers shining Stephen King's deadlights, the infinitely extending legs of a spider...

Or a hall of mirrors?

On a side note, I believe my cat has just proven to me that Shroedinger's cat is both alive and dead. True and False states are not mutually exclusive.

In other words, my cat has just proven to me one of the following:
<ul>
	<li>My cat perceives the three spatial dimensions the way I perceive two.</li>
	<li>There is an infinite reservoir of my cat waiting to be let in. Once inside, he heads to his food dish and disappears.</li>
	<li>My cat has found a secret exit from my home of which I'm unaware, despite my paranoia of intrusion.</li>
</ul>

I will now stop thinking about my magical cat and try to return to my original topic.

It seems that almost everything most people do with computers is social. The earliest simple consoles, where multiplayer meant multiple players playing on THIS ONE MACHINE or amongst this rat's nest of cables connecting portable gaming consoles. Remember cables? Remember consoles?

Wow.

Imagine a world where only one machine basically does everything... sound familiar?
A computer... Now that's a newfangled device worth mentioning.

was a brilliant concept in many of the already addictive home console systems.

Why just be a game when you could be a media hub as well?

Throw a text editor and spreadsheet in there and call it a day?

multiplayer graphics onscreen where you and your friends could toss about in the same arena to the ever-emerging nuances of cell phones, media players, tablets, and social networking sites.

Hostless protocols. Hell, why not clientless protocols. Do we really need the cols? Or can we just kick it with the rows.

When I first sat down to write this post, I was connected to the internet with download speeds nearing 10Mb/s. Now 100 is nothing to take a second glance at. When I first thought about blogging, (but was really more interested in playing Unreal Tournement), a T1 or T2 connection was Legit...

Flipping through webpages is no more time consuming than turning the page in a book, except this book is no less than a "Choose Your Own Adventure" where a middle click adds a bookmark, or dogear at just about any sized grab. (Come on, you know you held back a few choices to make sure you could undo one or two moves...) At the same time, there was always with printed media, the limitation of the physical endurance of the paper in the book itself. And without an unnecessary diatribe into the reasons why paper is weak, and marijuana is illegal (yeah, I went there), we'll use our crap rope and plastic cups to mope about and only dream of what could have been (in black and white, I'm sure).

Unlimited undo with diffs.

Yeah, unlimited. Or at least more than is probably necessary before we start crunching on your swap partition. Or by the time this post makes it to the masses, there will be enough RAM to just store everything we need without ever having to reboot. In the infinite mass of everything we'll just keep sticking data, letting loops of redundancy run off in a tangent perpendicular to any relevent dimensions.

Moore's Law and whatnot.

So, how much faster do we need to go?

Well, with the apparent dumbing down of society, in which we may graph population size vs the collective conciousness.

Flipping through webpages is often faster than turning the pages in a book ( I'm one of those careful readers, aware of the lifetime of books, I usually take care not to crease the pages, bend the spine, or smear the words... That's not to say I won't pencil in a note or two in the margin... [though sparingly]... but when the condition of the book is essentially the sum of all its mistreatment, I find it hard to condone even a single crease or tear ).

I still remember the first modem I was ever able to get my hands on (quite a while after it was cool, I'm sure), a 14.4Kb/s --- lightninginging.

Initially, we could use it for faxing, and we had a comfortable little suite of 16-bit Windows 3.1 Applications for sending and receiving faxes. Far behind us were those weak 8-bit machines. We had at least 256 colours. How many more could there be. (16.7 million hardly seems within grasp of my understanding).

Troubleshooting, not to be confused with shooting at trouble ( I don't recommend you shoot the monitor. )

A common source of confusion for those <em>unacquainted with networking </em> is the distinction between the IP address of your internet gateway and the IP address of your client computer (which may even be a server in its own right -- a duality quite beyond human understanding).
