Gone are the days of tediously searching for a blank <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">floppy</a> only to find it's corrupted and destroying itself in the disk bay. Gone are the days of having to carry around any media storage device whatsoever -- In fact, as a side effect of the machine that is the interweb (I'm using machine in its more metaphoric sense here, as a swarm of smaller, less powerful... er... machines).

Many people are still afraid of the cloud (I really want to tie in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClQcUyhoxTg" target="_blank">"Don't fear the Reaper"</a>), and in light of many of the recent big <a href="http://time.com/money/3528487/data-breach-identity-theft-jp-morgan-kmart-staples/">companies</a> being "<a href="http://fortune.com/2015/10/02/heres-whos-been-hacked-in-the-past-two-years/">hacked</a>" (I use the quotes here, as I'm using [to annoy all my geek friends] the popular, albeit incorrect term for network intrusion, theft, or phishing (since, we're jammin', I'll give an <strong>unrelated</strong> [in terms of computer tomfoolery {yes, expect deeply nested brackets &lt;What would I use here?&gt; } ]  shout out to the ever-popular non-mainstream band <a href="http://phish.com/" target="_blank">Phish</a>) by... 'Big Hacker' (I would tag <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)">Anonymous</a>, though I'm hesitant to degrade or promote any of these activities, so I'm not going to start taking sides, as I legitimately fear both, I guess the other side being... I honestly don't know anymore... [Can't we all just get along? or is that bad for business?] )... often fueled by ideas more than anything else tangible, and often constituent of mere teenagers via spirals of anonymous proxies or <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor</a>, these fears are not at all unfounded.

Now, before you go out there thinking you yourself can be anonymous, be wary of the obvious pitfalls that abound:

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>Your Internet Service Provider still knows what you're doing, and may dig a little deeper if they see you using anonymity procedures.</li>
	<li>Your e-cafe wireless is still monitored, your MAC is collected, you CAN be backtracked and triangulated, and most of your activities are easily determined by CC-TV, vehicular transit, and your phone.</li>
	<li>The police can be and are everywhere, and that's just within the boundaries of the technology they disclose. The big thing criminals forget is that forensic evidence remains. While the crime itself may have taken only seconds, the powers that be have weeks, months, years even, depending on whatever statute of limitations might apply, to systematically analyze and break down every microfibre of evidence. Again, do you really think you know every technology and method used? How long was RADAR a secret before it was leaked. Maybe you still think that carrots really contribute to pilots being able to see at night. There's some flat world theorists out there that will gladly fill your brain with chemtrail fantasies and conspiracies for every number and letter of the alphabet. When Edward Snowden unloaded his data, was I really the only one that wasn't the least bit surprised?</li>
</ul>

So, before you decide to fight for a cause, or just be a jerk, think about your actions and their ramifications. I'm writing this from the comfort of a first world country and all its amenities.

Nonetheless, the assault on our data is constant, overlapping, weaponized, and largely invisible. The term two-front war is now deprecated by an almost innumerable cluster of all-to-often open doors. As machines become smarter (or at least more programmable) and more accessible than ever before, the benefits are definitely culled by the responsibility and responsiveness of security <em>teams</em>. Where one guy may have been able to manage the infrastructure at a small- or medium-sized firm in the past, many problems have to be crowd sourced (internally, or course). Sometimes a second pair of eyes is all an issue needs to find a solution.

There is (are?) other good this advent of the singularity brings, however, and that is the increase of opportunities and <em>jobs</em>. (We all want jobs!) While some industries may have suffered fallout from the ever growing network of media transmission, consolidation of companies, and near monopolies looming ever-intimidatingly on the horizon, those with agile, and forward, out-of-the-box thinking will adapt, and in fact create more jobs that might just be a little less back-breaking than before. One may argue that where the jobs of yesteryear broke your body, the jobs of the future will break your soul (or at least your psyche) -- but that's what this whole Industrial Revolution has been about, right?

Of course, it may be a while before the new entry-level minimum wage employee is a system analyst, software engineer, interface designer, or pivot table architect, but there surely is better work out there than worm farming. (I'm talking about those slimy noodly-looking things you find in the dirt and use to catch fish, not the annoying software kind, which we'll inevitably encounter sometime down the line).

Getting back on point, I still recall the days past when classes and/or workshops required a disk, card, or usb flash drive to save user data across sessions on public computers. (Sadly I also remember the days when a floppy disk was actually "floppy", and having a hard drive for storage was considered a rich man's luxury).

[caption id="attachment_296" align="aligncenter" width="582"]<img class=" size-full wp-image-296 aligncenter" src="https://kb3c.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/z4w6xrn.jpg" alt="Z4w6XrN" width="582" height="830" /> Just imagine how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)" target="_blank">characters</a> I could store![/caption]

Now that security has become aware of the threat of foreign media intruding on working systems, these devices are not necessarily the best way to get the job done, and can often invite unwanted visitors or parasites to the party via trojan horses or worms (I told you we'd be here again)... (Just say NO to Autoplay).

[caption id="attachment_297" align="aligncenter" width="480"]<img class=" size-full wp-image-297 aligncenter" src="https://kb3c.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/hqdefault.jpg" alt="hqdefault" width="480" height="360" /> NOT EXACTLY what I was talking about...[/caption]

Assuming the data in question aren't secret or classified information (in which case, deeper levels of security would certainly be required), there's always an easy way to store it -- in the cloud -- and for those worried about prying eyes, just use some encryption... I mean, it doesn't take a rocket scientist (and if you are a rocket scientist, you should be able to fit an internal [private] cloud server on your budget...).

And it doesn't even require a new site with a new login, assuming of course you have an email. If the file is relatively small, say a text document, some source code, a midi, or just some .diff offsets, just email it as an attachment to yourself.  Without providing free advertisement for any of the free (as in beer) email providers out there, many of which with nearly unlimited online storage, it's not hard to find one that can hold on to a few documents up to a few megabytes. Obviously you're not going to be pushing across rendered 3d 4K video files or anything, but it's a lot easier than worrying about a physical medium on which to hold your files for a day.

I recall taking a class where we had to do some mundane word processing tasks and save our files. One student forgot her flash drive and was trying to either borrow/buy one from another student or leave and run to the store to get a new one. When I suggested emailing herself the file, she acted like I had discovered a new continent. I guess I'm amused at how narrowly and in the box some people think. (Not to say she wasn't smart, just maybe not as interested [in love / obsessed] with technology as I was, she could be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Osteopathic_Medicine" target="_blank">D.O.</a> now, or maybe even a Rocket Scientist for all I know.)

And that's just the beginning. One way to organize those files into a tidy package is to roll them into an archive (and optionally, compress).

Unix (and *nix / BSD / Solaris / SunOS) users are more than familiar with the <strong>.tar</strong> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)" target="_blank">[t]ape[ar]chive</a> ) [not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartar_sauce" target="_blank">tar-tar sauce</a>!] for grouping/collecting or consolidating files (and saving precious time when copying a copious amount of tediously small files); and its extensions;  <strong>.bz</strong> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2" target="_blank">bzip</a> ) [not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain" target="_blank">ccTLD</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bz" target="_blank">Belize</a>!], but the implementation of BWT ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform" target="_blank">the Burrows-Wheeler transform</a> ) <strong>.gz</strong> ( gzip ), ".xz" (xzip), etc., etc. Windows users may be more familiar with the ".zip" (pkzip) or ".7z" formats -- the ".zip" being provided natively in the OS, while the ".7z" format can be handled by free, open source software. Perhaps some users remember WinZip and or WinRAR from back in the day, while more advanced users may recall the expand application ".ex_" or command-line pkzip. To round out the standard desktop platforms, there's the Mac users, who may be familiar with Stuffit Expander, often ".sit" files.

To keep this blog (relatively slim), I'm going to leave out Package Management system files, such as ebuilds, .rpm, .deb, .yum, NSIS and wise installers and so on for a later post.

The reason I bring up compression is because one of the biggest bottlenecks in computing is the speed of data transmission across networks, via HDD (especially the older AT, IDE interfaces), from CD/DVD-ROM, USB/Firewire and/or Flash/SD media (especially older 1.0/2.0 interfaces), Tape Backups, Zip/Jazz drives, or floppies (3.5" or 5.25"). Maybe TMI, but the point is, data transfer can be slow, and multiple files also slow things down. In many cases (and I'll update with benchmarks), it's much faster to compress a file or files, send across, and then decompress on the other side than it would be to simply send the files all together.

There are many variables to consider, obviously, so the data table will take a moment to compile.

Factors such as processor speed and number of cores, memory (RAM) capacity and speed, method used, file type (text or binary), and amount of workload aside from the compression process(es), are just some of the variables.

As far as data transmission is concerned, there are errors to work around, line faults, dropped connections, and physical hardware failures as well as human error. It is for this reason there are ECC (Error Correction Codes) and file verification algorithms, such as MD5.

After all that, there is still a chance that data can become lost. Redundancy is key in all data-related situations. My father always told me of a classic data strategy -- "Grandfather, Father, Son"... which is three good copies in different houses. Some people may dial that up to 7, or 11 -- it's difficult to say if there is an upper limit that is considered "safe".

&nbsp;

In a future post, I'll dig into RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Devices) setups a bit to explain more about the redundant backup principle (not all RAID setups protect your data), and dig in a little more to ".diff"s and using CVS/RCS/git (Concurrent Versioning System / Revision Control System / git ) techniques on data other than source code.
