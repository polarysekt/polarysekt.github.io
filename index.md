## Welcome

"We're glad you made it 'till today."

## Introduction

If the GIANT hamburger menu is a bit much, then maybe you need a sit-down lunch - you can scroll down to the footer &rarr; (put on your dickies for this one -- ) we have more clickies. ( And no, that's not a thing, I just made that up.)

Still underwater, but portable, and we've got a bubble with a kevlar-like surface tension.

In any case, we're mostly not borken, seein' as we're porkin with `premium` squigglers -- in the VIP (cause we luxe like that...) [ain't that right, morgen?]

#### Quote of the week

"There's an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone.
That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone."

`*- B. Stroustrup
