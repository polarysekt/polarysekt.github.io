title: It's hard to be undercover when it is this warm
----

Pins, needles and knives, and hedges -
Of needlessly contrived, sharp protruding edges -
Wise -
But that is to say, ignorant enough,
To succumb to honeycomb hives, where once a bee surmized,

"I think that daffodils require a bit more than ultraviolet, and water"

This ultraviolence, unfaltered, 
Should be sheathed and stored in a high quarters,
or at least high up places, 
prior facelifts repelling uncanny storytelling, 
and at least a keen insight requires, the keys to leaves ...

with bins to an extent, retires the wheels, 
to believe the tails, of what can be done, 
but that goes without saying.

The [fend] in fencers play defendant, though 
around the house lately remains distendant with disdain 
while lacklucster comments abound.

They can relieve head trauma, realizing a need for marijuana,
recursive offsite backup, unwind the stackup, 
but it takes time,
to regenerate a rollback overlay.

So we call Mr. Sawyer and see how the Good ol' Boys 'been handling.

Grand, father, son. No need to retract, just sit back, and enjoy the foolery, Tom.

Don't sit too close to the fire, and enjoy the evaporated water. ("Taste the humidity").

Chagrined, and burned out, in a minute, fleeting last seconds recalled with hesistance,
But within the last two times and we'd been in it, 
regardless of whether we'd win it, (or much less, be in it),
the challenge gave structure.
And those roots had entwined so deep and so spread out that,
repeat the previous line.

Last time, rewind, precise to the minute hand. A band, revamped, hand in hand with 
the aforementioned uncanny storytelling.
