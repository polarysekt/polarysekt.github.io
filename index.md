"Glad you made it 'till today."


## Welcome

If the GIANT hamburger menu is a bit much, then maybe you need a sit-down lunch - you can scroll down to the footer, wherein we have more clickies. No, that's not a thing, I just made that up.

Still underwater, but portable, and we've got a bubble with a kevlar-like surface tension.

In any case, we're mostly not borken, seein' as we're porkin with premium squigglers

"There's an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. | 
That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone." |
