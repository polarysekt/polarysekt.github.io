# Get Stoked

This is a work in progress.

However some of the notes may be already useful, so instead of putting it in drafts, we put it here.

## Do Research

Before jumping in to the market, it is probably a good idea to at least familiarize yourself with the basics of stock trading.

As this section expands, it will eventually find its way to its own post.


## Get a broker

There are a lot of brokers out there, and the firm you select to handle your trades will depend upon the type of trading you intend to perform.

### RobinHood

Some traders like to micromanage their own stocks and ETFs, without the restriction of trade windows.

Additionally, some investors are interested in cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, and they want a way to round trip (cash in and cash out) into their more familiar and more widely used currency.

Also, quite unlike trading equities on the market, cryptocurrency is always open.

Using this referral for RobinHood, you can get a free stock when you create an account:

Now, SEC regulations require 3 days for a trade to be settled, so you won't be able to trade your stock for that duration.

In general, when you sell a stock, the value does not become available until the trade has settled. However, RobinHood actually allows you to utilize this value immediately up to a specified buying power limit.

The basic, default, low-tier account is usually allowed around $1000 USD immediate buying power. Technically, you are receiving a loan towards buying power while awaiting the trade settlement.

There are a few things you'll want once you dig in a little and start trading.


## The Grind

When getting started, whether you decide to invest money, or whether you just start turning gains from the free stock handouts, you're probably not going to be working with a whole lot of buying power.

So, assuming you made around five or ten dollars with your initial free stock, you want to trade in stocks under that amount.

As you may have heard, diversity is often a good strategy, as there are times when certain sectors just don't perform, while others excel. Similar to the `single point of failure` or `all your eggs in one basket`, you don't necessarily want all your investment in a single stock. Even within a particular sector you may want a few companies, even those that compete with one another.

### Return on Investment

You may hear the term ROI, or return on investment. As you will hear often, your ROI can decrease to 0%, at which point there is no value. However, there is not a ceiling to this ratio. In other words, you can well exceed 100% and that profit can in turn be used to diversify or strengthen current positions.

One strategy to protect your ROI is to remove your initial investment once there is enough gain to operate effectively. So, if you start with a $20 investment, and play around and make some gains, once you reach $40, pull out your initial investment of $20, and now you can take greater risks knowing that your worst case scenario is breaking even.

If you've ever gambled at a casino or with a lottery, you may have experienced a loss where the temptation is to "chase," or continue to gamble, just to get back to where you started. This is NOT what you want to be doing. You may have also heard the term "tilt," usually meaning flustered in a way that draws in emotion.

Emotion is detrimental to rational, logical thought. It's a mind game as much as a money game, and psychological plays are often an unspoken part of an effective strategy.

When playing statistics, it is of utmost importance to maintain a cool mind and demeanor. It's probably more useful to do research and investigate companies while the market is closed, so you can execute moves without having to dig through the current day's hype.
